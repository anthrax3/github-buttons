## GitHub Buttons

Basically, a standalone Javascript version of [mdo/github-buttons](https://github.com/mdo/github-buttons). The reason for this library is that @mdo's version doesn't work with SSL, and using iframes is silly.

### API

Place the buttons wherever on the page. They should have `class="github-btn"`. You may want to have a `class="hide"` as well. You should handle the loading states yourself.

All options as shown on [mdo/github-buttons](https://github.com/mdo/github-buttons) are available through `data-*` attributes. View the demo for basically every possible variation of buttons.

Whatever. WTFPL. It's not really mine.
